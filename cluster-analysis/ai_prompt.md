## Analysis Request
Based on the information above:
1. Please analyze the overall health of this Kubernetes cluster. The configured health threshold is 90% of pods in Running state - is the cluster meeting this requirement?
2. Identify any issues or concerns based on the pod statuses.
3. For each problematic pod, diagnose the likely cause of the issue and suggest specific solutions based on the detailed information provided.
4. Provide a general assessment of the cluster configuration based on the namespace and pod distribution.
5. Are there any potential bottlenecks or resource constraints that might be indicated by this data?
6. Evaluate the node capacity relative to the workload. Is the cluster appropriately sized?

This analysis will be used to improve the cluster's stability and performance.
